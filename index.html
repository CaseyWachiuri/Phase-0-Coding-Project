		<h1>Let Them</h1>
		<p>A poem by Cassie</p>

		<section class="poem">
			<p id="My paragraph">If they want to choose something or someone over you, <span class="highlight">LET
					THEM</span>.</p>
			<p>If they want to go weeks without talking to you, <span class="highlight">LET THEM</span>.</p>
			<p>If they are okay with never seeing you, <span class="highlight">LET THEM</span>.</p>
			<p>If they are okay with always putting themselves first, <span class="highlight">LET THEM</span>.</p>
			<p>If they are showing you who they are and not what you perceived them to be, <span class="highlight">LET
					THEM</span>.</p>
			<p>If they want to follow the crowd, <span class="highlight">LET THEM</span>.</p>
			<p>If they want to judge or misunderstand you, <span class="highlight">LET THEM</span>.</p>
			<p>If they act like they can live without you, <span class="highlight">LET THEM</span>.</p>
			<p>If they want to walk out of your life and leave, hold the door open, AND <span class="highlight">LET
					THEM</span>.</p>
			<p><strong>Let them lose you.</strong><br> You were never theirs because you were always your own.<br> So let
				them.</p>

			<p><strong>Let them show you who they truly are, not tell you.</strong></p>
			<p>Let them prove how worthy they are of your time.<br> Let them make the necessary steps to be a part of your
				life.<br> Let them earn your forgiveness.<br> Let them call you to talk about ordinary things.<br> Let them take
				you out on a Thursday.<br> Let them talk about anything and everything just because it’s you they are talking
				to.<br> Let them have a safe place in you.<br> Let them see the heart in you that didn’t harden.<br> Let them
				love you.</p>
